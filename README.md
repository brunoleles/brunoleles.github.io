Babylon.js Boilerplate
======================
A boilerplate project that serves as a scaffold for quickly setting up new
[Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) projects.

This includes a gulp pipeline which supports ES6 (via Babel) and automatically
obtains the latest Babylon.js and Oimo.js (physics library) builds.


To use
------
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/bdero/babylonjs-boilerplate.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the watcher using the **dev** command: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to **http://localhost:8080**
5. Begin hacking on the code, and the watcher will automatically recompile on save.
